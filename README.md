# Lesion_Detection_and_Segmentation_of_Diabetic_Retinopathy
This project focuses on lesion segmentation for diabetic retinopathy detection using retinal images. It includes the identification of hemorrhages, micro-aneurysms, and exudates (hard and soft), aiding in early diagnosis. Blood vessel and optic disc segmentation are not included.
